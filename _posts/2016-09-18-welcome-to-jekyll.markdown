# Horizon Plots
The horizon plot solves some problems of plotting energy performance.

1. __What Does Up Mean?__ Defining up versus down is confusing.  Up could mean improvement of increase in energy intensity.  Here color is clearer - green is good, red is bad.  I used the Pink-to-Green/Yellow Color Brewer platte.   

#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
